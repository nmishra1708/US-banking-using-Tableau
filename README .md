## Implementation Details - 

 Create an asymmetric drop down of Region with their respective customer names
and their Balances with a gender wise color code. Use set actions to complete this
task.
 A region wise bar chart which displays the count of customers based on High and
low balance. Create a parameter to let the users’ dynamically decide the limit
value of balance which categorizes it into high and low.
 Create a donut pie chart which displays a percent of total balances in a region
wise manner.
 Display a forecast with a day wise balance chart using Exponential smoothing.
 Create a stacked bar chart to view the gender wise average age in every region.
 Analyze the distribution of a measure (Balance) using a Histogram and create a
parameter to let the users’ dynamically decide the bin size.
 Compare the month wise balance using a motion chart with marks and trails.
 Create a moving average balance line chart, average calculated for a period of past
2 weeks. Compare it with the actual values.
 Compare the region wise average balance with the (region wise average balance)
in-terms of its job classifications.
 Region wise pie chart displaying the job classifications with respect to its
balances.
 Create a global date range parameter.
 Include interactive filters for Job classifications and Highlighters for Region in the
final dashboard.
